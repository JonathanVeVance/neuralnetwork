# Foobar

Foobar is a Python library for dealing with word pluralization.

## What is it?

This is a personal project that I undertook to code a neural network API, similar to keras Sequential API, from scratch.

So far, I have included:
* ReLu and sigmoid activation layers,
* Sum of squares and cross entropy loss functions,
* Adam, rmsprop, momentum accelerators
* Stochastic and mini batch gradient descents

## Future work

* I have only coded for single output neurons, this can be extended to multiple unit output layers
* Batch normalization - this will take a significant amount of code changes on top of the current API
